Spotube is a lightweight, open-source music streaming app that combines Spotifyâ€™s huge music library with free, ad-free playback. Instead of relying on heavy official clients, it uses the Spotify API to pull in song details, playlists, and album information, while streaming the actual audio from free public sources. This keeps the app fast, privacy-friendly, and easy on system resources.

Spotube highlights my skills in Python, Django, JavaScript, and REST API integration, and serves as an example of creating a real-world, data-driven application from concept to working product.

With Spotube, users can log in to their Spotify account to access personal playlists, follow their favorite artists, and explore trending music. It offers a sleek, user-friendly interface designed for smooth navigation, making music discovery and playback effortless. The app supports cross-platform compatibility, meaning it works on Windows, Linux, macOS, and even mobile devices.
